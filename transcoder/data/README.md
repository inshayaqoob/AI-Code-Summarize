# Raw Data:

### Description:

We release our validation and test dataset. You can download the raw data [here](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/transcoder/TransCoder_tokenized_test_set_functions.zip). 

The format of each line in each file is `<FUNCTION_ID> | <function>`. The function are tokenized. You can detokenize them with the script preprocessing/detokenize.py. You can extract the function id and use it to find the corresponding test script in `data/evaluation/geeks_for_geeks_successful_test_scripts/<language>` if it exists.

For instance, for the line `COUNT_SET_BITS_IN_AN_INTEGER_3 | <function>` in the file test.cpp.shuf.valid.tok, the corresponding test script can be found in `data/evaluation/geeks_for_geeks_successful_test_scripts/cpp/COUNT_SET_BITS_IN_AN_INTEGER_3.cpp`. 
If the script is missing, it means there was an issue with our automatically created tests for the corresponding function.

The code generated by your model can be tested by injecting it where the `TO_FILL` comment is in the test script.
